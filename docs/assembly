Subleq assembly code specifications.

Opcode format:
    A, B
    or
    A, B, C
    If C is excluded, C is taken as the location of the next instruction

labels:
    label_name:
    labels are referenced by name: label_name
    labels can be used anywhere where numbers can be used
    you can get a value n words after the lable by doing label_name$n

data:
    storing data is done by placing a . at the beginning of a line.
    There are two types of data that can be stored:
        String:
            . "some string", 0
        Number:
            . -1234
            . 0xDEADBEEF
            . 0777, 32, 0xFFFF
    You can also reserve a block of memory to use for data storage:
        .resv [number of words to reserve]

static definitions:
    You can create a definition that will replace all instances of its name with a specified numeric value:
        .defn def_name, value
    For example:
        .defn ser_out, 0x101
        _Z, ser_out ==> _Z, 0x101


comments:
    comments are specified by placing a # before the text you want to comment:
        #This a comment
